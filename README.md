# C-_Inventory_Management_Project

The course project is designed to be completed over the five weeks of the term. At the end of each week, you will need to turn in a work product representing a portion of the project. It is also a check for you to make sure you are progressing toward on-time completion.

The approved project is:

**Technology Inventory Management system with SQLite Connector**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The C# program with allow a user to manage the inventory by adding items, viewing what is currently on hand, updating details related to the item, and removing items as they could be purchased, broken, or just no longer needed. 

The application will run in the terminal where the end user can interact with the application through input commands. The main goal of the program is to simulate how a small electronics business manages their hardware. 
The purpose of my program is to use and show practical application of Object-Oriented Programming while also providing a solution for a real life scenario. 

Electronics and computer parts need to be tracked to run an efficient business, like PC repair shops or IT departments that manage PC refresh lifecycles. An application like this will help prevent loss of equipment, over ordering, keeping up with stock levels, and improve planning for replacement or 
repairs.

The application should output clear and readable text to the terminal window. The program will display appropriate menu options to navigate to desired options, like add, remove, modify, and view. The structure of the database storing the information will have elements such as an ID number, or other 
unique identifier, name, category, quantity, and price. The system will also output when an item is changed and who made the change.
